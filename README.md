# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

The project is about the page, where everyone can share their travel pictures and stories while traveling around the US.
**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. It is made for desktop, tablet and mobile phone screen sizes.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
